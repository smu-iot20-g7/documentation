# Hawker centre dilemma: "Must return trays _meh_?"

We've always been taught in schools to clear our receptacles after eating â€“ but in practice, how many of us actually do that? I, for one, am guilty of not returning after eating as well. After all, there are cleaners looking after the hawker centres. So I figured that, unlike schools, there will always be people clearing after me.
