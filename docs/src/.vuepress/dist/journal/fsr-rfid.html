The main objective of this solution is to make it portable and obstruction-free so it will not hinder hawkers' operations. We will be monitoring negative tray return rate by looking at number of tray return to the trolley, with this data we can do some manipulation and we are able to calculate the postive tray return rate.</p> <h3 id="tray-out"><a href="#tray-out" class="header-anchor">#</a> Tray Out</h3> <p>To detect the tray out from the hawker stalls, we used the <b>Round Force Sensor</b> and <b>RFID Sensor</b> together with our RaspberryPi. We have strategically placed our sensors on a board which can detect when a tray is placed on it and when a tray is removed from it.</p> <p>Thus, when a tray is removed from the board, the program in the RaspberryPi will add a tray-out count into the database.</p> <h3 id="tray-in"><a href="#tray-in" class="header-anchor">#</a> Tray In</h3> <p>At the hawker, we observed that there are two common ways which trays are being returned; the first being the patron returning to the tray return point and the second being the cleaners returning the trays to the cleaners' trolley.</p> <p>To count the number of tray return from the patrons, we take the number of tray out from the above method and deduct it by the number of trays returned by the cleaners. The number of trays returned by the cleaners into the trolley is counted by using the <b>Round Force Sensor</b> and <b>Motion Sensor</b> together with the RaspberryPi.</p> <p>With strategic placement of our sensors on the trolley, we are able to detect when the cleaners place a tray onto the trolley which will trigger our program in the RaspberryPi to add a tray-in count into our database.</p> <h2 id="sensor-modalities"><a href="#sensor-modalities" class="header-anchor">#</a> Sensor Modalities</h2> <h3 id="how-it-works-tray-out"><a href="#how-it-works-tray-out" class="header-anchor">#</a> How it works - Tray Out</h3> <p>To collect the tray-out data, our aim is to provide a <b>hassle-free</b> and <b>obstruction-free set up</b> for the hawker while collecting accurate data.</p> <p>To do so, we used velcros to place our RaspberryPi and sensor board so that it is easy for the hawker to tear down and set up every day. As our solution, will be placed in extreme condition such as heat from boiling water or even possible water spillage. Our team waterproof the entire board using delt and ziplock bag to waterproof the RaspberryPi with just a gap to slot in the power source. On the sensor board, we have the round force sensor and RFID sensor which detects when a tray is placed together and when there is weight placed on the tray.</p> <p>Once the tray is removed from the sensor board, our program will add a tray-out count into the database.</p> <h4 id="summarise-flow"><a href="#summarise-flow" class="header-anchor">#</a> Summarise Flow:</h4> <ol><li>Tray being placed on the board - Force detected (Value change from 0 to 1)</li> <li>Food being placed on the tray the weight will push the tray down - RFID Detected (Value change from 0 to 1)</li> <li>Data will be added into the database once the tray is being removed (FSR and RFID value will be reset to 0)</li></ol> <h3 id="sensors-we-use"><a href="#sensors-we-use" class="header-anchor">#</a> Sensors we use</h3> <ul><li>Round Force Sensor (FSR)</li> <li>RFID Sensor \</li></ul> <h4 id="view-our-tray-in-setup"><a href="#view-our-tray-in-setup" class="header-anchor">#</a> View Our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc8Itq1mNtk&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tray in Setup<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></h4> <p>Here is a short clip on how we setup our tray in method.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/tray-out.93fc08bc.gif" alt="Data"></p> <h3 id="how-it-works-tray-in"><a href="#how-it-works-tray-in" class="header-anchor">#</a> How it works - Tray In</h3> <p>We placed our sensor board in the middle rack of the trolley as we observed that most of the used trays taken from the hawker table by the cleaner were being placed in the middle rack.</p> <p>On the sensor board, we have our round force sensor to detect when there is tray placed on the board. This allows us to track the first tray-in count on the trolley and add the relevant count into the database. For subsequent tray-in counts, we used the motion sensor which is placed directly above the board to detect the motion when more trays are placed into the trolley. Upon detection of tray placed into the trolley, we add a tray-in count into the database.</p> <p>The round force sensor also help to track when the cleaner remove the stack of trays collected from the trolley back to the stall, when we detect motion and there is no force detected we will take it as a trays had been removed from the trolley.</p> <p>Lastly, as the trolley must be mobile and cannot be connected to a power source at all times, we used a portable charger to power the RaspberryPi which was attached to our sensor board.</p> <h4 id="summarise-flow-2"><a href="#summarise-flow-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Summarise Flow:</h4> <ol><li>When a tray is being placed on the trolley - Force detected (Value change from 0 to 1) - Motion detected (Value change from 0 to 1)</li> <li>Data will then be added to the database</li> <li>Once tray is being removed from the trolley - Motion detected (Value change from 0 to 1) - Force not detected (Value change from 1 to 0)</li> <li>Add a minus 1 count to the database</li></ol> <h3 id="sensors-we-use-2"><a href="#sensors-we-use-2" class="header-anchor">#</a> Sensors we use</h3> <ul><li>Round Force Sensor (FSR)</li> <li>Motion Sensor <br> <img src="/assets/img/tray-in.cdd91536.gif" alt="Data"></li></ul> <h2 id="data-insights-and-accuracy"><a href="#data-insights-and-accuracy" class="header-anchor">#</a> Data, Insights and Accuracy</h2> <h3 id="data"><a href="#data" class="header-anchor">#</a> Data</h3> <p><img src="/assets/img/mongomac.cb417b6b.gif" alt="Data">

This was consistent across all days of data that we have collected.

With reference to the above figure, we used the percent error formula to calculate the accuracy of our data. The data accuracy for <strong>Tray-Out</strong> is at <strong>85%</strong>, while the data accuracy for <strong>Tray-In</strong> is at <strong>46%</strong>.</p> <p>The reason why Tray-In data is not accurate was because the motion sensor used are too sensitive and there is no configuration for current motion sensor that we are using.

In addition, the movement of the trolley causes the motion sensor to shake and lower the accuracy of the data collected for Tray-in.</p> <h3 id="multiple-tray-return-to-the-trolley-at-once"><a href="#multiple-tray-return-to-the-trolley-at-once" class="header-anchor">#</a> Multiple Tray return to the trolley at once</h3> <p>As our motion sensor and force sensor are binary sensor, it is only to gather and return information of a state (either 0 or 1). Hence, the sensors, in our Tray-In solution, are not able to differentiate between the quantity of the trays entry.</p> <h3 id="cleaner-directly-return-to-stall"><a href="#cleaner-directly-return-to-stall" class="header-anchor">#</a> Cleaner directly return to stall</h3> <p>For convinience sake, cleaners may choose to return trays directly back to the store.

Hence, data collected will only reflects a sector of the hawker center. However, to make best use of our current limitation, we chose the trolley situated closest to our hawker stall based on our observation of where most of the patrons will likely to be seated at, after purchasing their food, so we could maximize our coverage of the hawker center.</p> <h3 id="limited-range-of-rfid-sensor"><a href="#limited-range-of-rfid-sensor" class="header-anchor">#</a> Limited range of RFID sensor</h3> <p>The RFID sensor only had a detection range of 5-7CM, which are only detectable near contact. Hence, tray has to be placed in a precise position for the RFID sensor to detect. To overcome this solution, our team have pasted 2 RFID stickers on both side of the tray to ensure that the RFID sensor is able to detect the tray accurately. RFID range will also be affected with any metal product nearby, for our solution we overcome this by putting a styrofoam board between the sensors and the metal cabinet to reduce the impact on our RFID reader.</p> <h2 id="key-benefits-of-our-solution"><a href="#key-benefits-of-our-solution" class="header-anchor">#</a> Key Benefits Of Our Solution</h2> <p>The key benefits includes:</p> <ul><li>Automating data collection process</li> <li>Identifying patrons behavior during specific periods of time</li></ul> <h3 id="automating-data-collection-process"><a href="#automating-data-collection-process" class="header-anchor">#</a> Automating data collection process</h3> <p>With the IoT solution deployed, we could automate the manual data collection process of tray return and could provide reliable counting without possible human errors as our IoT solution has shown high accuracy of the data collected.</p> <h3 id="identifying-patrons-behavior-during-specific-periods-of-time"><a href="#identifying-patrons-behavior-during-specific-periods-of-time" class="header-anchor">#</a> Identifying patrons behavior during specific periods of time</h3> <p>The dashboard feature allow us to view tray return rate for specific periods of time.

With such a useful insight, we could pin point the reason behind such behavior and works towards creating campaign and solution targeted at the specific timing or patrons.</p> <h2 id="main-video"><a href="#main-video" class="header-anchor">#</a> Main Video</h2> <h3 id="to-see-how-our-solution-works-at-the-hawker"><a href="#to-see-how-our-solution-works-at-the-hawker" class="header-anchor">#</a> To see how our solution works at the hawker:</h3> <h4 id="view-our-pitch-video"><a href="#view-our-pitch-video" class="header-anchor">#</a> View Our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TglGIDq8pWQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pitch Video<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></h4> <h4 id="view-our-group-video"><a href="#view-our-group-video" class="header-anchor">#</a> View Our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRFURIfBGSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Group video<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></h4></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
